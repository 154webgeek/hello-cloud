# Hello, Cloud!

This is a simple app designed to test the deployment and functionality of a cloud function. 

## How It Works
- The app sends a message to a cloud function (e.g., AWS Lambda or Google Cloud).
- The cloud function processes the message and responds with a confirmation.

## Purpose
This project is intended to demonstrate the basics of app deployment using GitHub, cloud functions, and CI/CD automation.
